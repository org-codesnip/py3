This repo contains useful data structures for LeetCode (or anything, really).
This includes

* Ordered Multiset
* Disjoint Set with Path Compression
* Prefix Tree (trie)
* Memorization for Top-down DP

These data structures are best-effort minimal implementations.
Time and space complexity are usually the expected values, e.g.
$O(\log n)$ for B-trees, etc.
